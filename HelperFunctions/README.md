- AugHelpers: Contains the helper functions for properly augmenting the image datasets
- ModelConfigHelpers: Contains the helper functions for getting pre-trained models,customizing them (final layer customizations) and training the models
- InferenceHelpers : Contains the helper functions for using the trained models to make predictions on test data
